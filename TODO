- podman/docker provisioner for a static mosquitto broker, config in volumes, keys tbd.
- find a way to send config updates/acl updates with only restart (sighup on config file changes?, volume updater?)
- experiment with the idea of a mosquitto manager that listens in the swarm to get config/acl updates, verifies updates the files and sends the sighup?
- something should publish public changes for clients too (maybe each broker should publish it's data? or just use the configs?)
- dns mappings how to maintain for each broker?
- client target arduino
- client target web
- client target python
